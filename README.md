 # About AnswerChain
AnswerChain provides an offline, passwordless recovery system that empowers individuals and organizations to restore secrets securely. By allowing users to create their own knowledge-based questions and answer options, secrets can be rebuilt without relying on passwords‚Äîprotected by modern cryptography to ensure safety and trust.



&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;







## ‚ùì How it works  

1Ô∏è‚É£. **User defines their own questions**  
You create your own security questions (e.g., *‚ÄúWhat was my first pet‚Äôs name?‚Äù*)  
and provide multiple answer alternatives.  

---

2Ô∏è‚É£. **Standard and Critical questions**  
When setting up your recovery kit, each question can be marked as:  
- **Standard** ‚Üí regular knowledge prompts (e.g., *‚ÄúWhat city were you born in?‚Äù*).  
  These contribute shares toward the recovery threshold and allow flexibility.  
- **Critical** ‚Üí high-value prompts (e.g., *‚ÄúWhat is the code phrase I only told my family?‚Äù*).  
  These must **always** be answered correctly for secret restoration to be possible ‚Äî  
  even if all standard questions are answered correctly.  

This two-tier system combines **usability** (standard questions)  
with **mandatory checkpoints** (critical questions) for maximum security.  

---

3Ô∏è‚É£. **Every alternative is cryptographically protected**  
Each alternative is combined with a random salt and processed through **Argon2id** (a memory-hard key derivation function).  
The derived key is used to encrypt a **Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)** share with **cascade encryption**:  
- First layer: **AES-256-GCM**  
- Second layer: **ChaCha20-Poly1305**  

This dual-layer (**cascade AEAD**) ensures ciphertexts all have the same structure  
and strengthens security against single-algorithm weaknesses that the future could present.  

---

4Ô∏è‚É£. **Wrong answers look valid too**  
Incorrect answers are not left empty. Instead, they carry **dummy SSS shares**,  
also Argon2id-hardened and cascade-encrypted (AES-256-GCM + ChaCha20-Poly1305).  

This makes every answer **indistinguishable**, so attackers cannot know which ones are correct.  

---

5Ô∏è‚É£. **Decoy ‚Äúreal‚Äù answers**  
Users can define **decoy real answers** that decrypt into plausible but fake secrets.  
Even if an attacker manages to decrypt shares, they cannot tell  
whether the reconstructed output is the genuine secret or a decoy.  

---

6Ô∏è‚É£. **Secret recovery**  
During recovery, you answer your own questions. Each chosen alternative is re-processed  
with **Argon2id** and **cascade decryption**.  

- If the correct set of **Standard questions** is answered,  
  enough valid **SSS shares** may be obtained.  
- But recovery will only succeed if **all required Critical questions** are also answered correctly.  

If both conditions are met, the valid shares can be recombined to reconstruct the secret.  

---

7Ô∏è‚É£. **Final authentication**  
The reconstructed secret undergoes a final **Argon2id + HMAC check**.  
Only if this verification succeeds is the secret accepted as authentic.  


&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;




# üîí Why the Security Questions File is Secure  

---

## 1. Key Derivation  
Every answer is combined with a random salt and processed through **Argon2id**  
with enforced high memory cost (‚â•1 GiB, parallelism pinned to 1).  
This makes brute-force attacks prohibitively expensive,  
even for attackers using modern GPUs or ASICs.  

---

## 2. Cascade Encryption  
Each derived key is used in **cascade encryption**, first with **AES-256-GCM**  
and then with **ChaCha20-Poly1305**.  
This guarantees ciphertexts are uniform in structure and provides long-term resilience:  
even if one cipher is broken in the future, the other still protects the data.  

---

## 3. Secret Splitting (SSS)  
The protected secret is never stored directly but split into shares using  
**Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing (SSS)**.  
A defined threshold of correct answers must be provided to recombine the secret,  
while any subset below the threshold reveals absolutely nothing.  

---

## 4. Standard vs. Critical Questions  
Questions can be **standard** or **critical**.  
- Standard questions ‚Üí contribute shares toward the threshold.  
- Critical questions ‚Üí must always be answered correctly.  

Secret restoration is **impossible** if even one critical question is wrong,  
regardless of how many standard answers are correct.  

---

## 5. Wrong Answers and Decoys  
Wrong answers are indistinguishable from correct ones because they also decrypt into  
**dummy shares** hardened with Argon2id and cascade AEAD.  

Users can also configure **decoy real answers**, which produce plausible but fake secrets.  
These protections ensure attackers can never know whether a recovered result is genuine or a decoy.  

---

## 6. Final Verification  
Once enough shares are collected, the reconstructed secret must pass a  
**final Argon2id + HMAC verification step**.  
This prevents tampering and guarantees that only the genuine secret is accepted.  

---

## 7. Offline and Passwordless  
The entire system is **offline and passwordless**, eliminating risks associated with  
servers, cloud storage, or a single vulnerable master password.  
Everything needed for recovery is self-contained.  

---

## 8. Leak Resilience  
The system is deliberately designed to remain secure **even if the complete file,  
all ciphertexts, salts, and parameters leak online**.  

Attackers gain no useful advantage because:  
- Argon2id makes brute-force infeasible.  
- Cascade AEAD ensures dual-layer protection.  
- Dummy shares and decoys make answers indistinguishable.  
- Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing prevents partial leakage.  
- Critical questions block recovery without mandatory checkpoints.  
- The HMAC gate validates authenticity.  

---

## 9. Brute-Force Cost Analysis  
After setup, the program presents a **brute-force cost analysis**,  
showing the estimated difficulty of cracking the configuration with modern hardware.  

Users can then adjust Argon2id parameters, thresholds, or question sets  
if they want even stronger security.  

## 10. Uses trusted encryption libraries

# Example of a feature that could be added (I need your help)!

<details>
  <summary># üîí Privacy Protection via Tolerance-Based Authentication for the security questions</summary>

### Example Feature Idea
**Privacy protection of security questions using tolerance-based authentication.**

- All masked answers combine into a single unlock key ‚Üí hiding both personal data *and* the questions.  
- With **tolerance-based authentication**, small typos are accepted (e.g., `bakke` ‚Üí `backe`, `bakie`), balancing **usability and security**.  
- Redundancy across multiple questions provides **resilience and accessibility**.

Features:

Automated Triggers:
If you fail to respond to a recurring prompt (e.g., an email sent at fixed intervals) within a specified time frame, a predefined action will be triggered. For example, a physical letter could be dispatched with instructions on how to proceed.

Server-Side Security:
The system can leverage server-side hardware (e.g., HSM modules) to enhance overall security and safeguard cryptographic processes.

Customizable User Conditions:
It can be programmed with detailed specifications, such as:

Denying authentication if you are under duress (e.g., held against your will).

Allowing decryption only at specific times or intervals.

Triggering auto-destruction of sensitive data if user-defined conditions are met.

Human and AI-Assisted Support:
Flexible integration of human support teams and/or AI-based assistance tailored to your specific use case.

Controlled Information Flow:
The system can hold encrypted questions or instructions and release them only after successful authentication. You decide exactly what information is stored server-side.

Contingency Features:
Optional safeguards include contacting trusted relatives or designated parties if you fail to respond within set time limits.
