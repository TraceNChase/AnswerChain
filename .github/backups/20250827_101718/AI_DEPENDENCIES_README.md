# AI Dependencies Removed

## What Happened
Workflows using external AI APIs (like OpenAI) have been disabled to remove external dependencies.

## Disabled Workflows
The following workflows were renamed with `.disabled.yml` extension:
- .github/workflows/ai-remediation.disabled.yml
- .github/workflows/enhanced-reporting.disabled.yml

## How to Restore
1. Complete backup was created in `.github/backups/[timestamp]`
2. Each disabled workflow has a `.bak` file with the original content
3. To restore: rename files to remove the `.disabled` extension

## Next Steps
To replace the AI functionality:
1. Consider using local analysis tools
2. Update workflows to use built-in GitHub security features
3. Implement custom analysis scripts that don't rely on external APIs
