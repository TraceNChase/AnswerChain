# Repo CodeQL Queries

Place small, focused custom queries here.

Guidelines
- Keep each query tight with a single purpose.
- Add a `@id`, `@kind problem`, `@precision`, `@problem.severity`, and `@tags` (include CWE tags).
- Prefer teaching-quality messages.

Testing
- Use the CodeQL CLI locally to evaluate queries against a CodeQL DB of this repo.
- Keep false positives low; document rationale in comments.
