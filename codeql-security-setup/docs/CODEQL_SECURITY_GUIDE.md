# CodeQL Security Setup Guide

## Overview
This repository has been configured with GitHub's CodeQL security scanning for automatic code analysis. CodeQL is a semantic code analysis engine that can find security vulnerabilities across your codebase.

## Features Implemented

1. **Automated CodeQL Analysis**
   - Runs on all push events to main/master branches
   - Runs on all pull requests to main/master branches
   - Scheduled weekly scans (Sunday at midnight)
   - Manual trigger option available

2. **Extended Security Coverage**
   - Uses security-extended and security-and-quality query suites
   - Custom queries for specific vulnerability patterns
   - Comprehensive language support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python

3. **Optimized Configuration**
   - Excludes test files, node_modules, and distribution directories
   - Filters out specific queries that may cause false positives
   - Focuses scan on source code directories

## How It Works

1. **Workflow Execution**
   - GitHub Actions runs the CodeQL workflow based on the triggers
   - The workflow checks out the code and initializes CodeQL
   - The code is built (if necessary) using the autobuild feature
   - CodeQL analyzes the code using the configured queries
   - Results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab

2. **Viewing Results**
   - Go to the Security tab in GitHub
   - Select "Code scanning alerts"
   - Review and triage findings

3. **Custom Queries**
   - Located in `codeql-security-setup/.github/codeql/custom-queries/`
   - Can be extended with additional queries as needed

## Adding More Languages

To add more languages to the scan:
1. Edit `codeql-security-setup/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`
2. Add additional languages to the matrix
3. Available languages: javascript, typescript, python, java, go, cpp, ruby, csharp

## Adding Custom Queries

To add more custom queries:
1. Add query files (*.ql) to `codeql-security-setup/.github/codeql/custom-queries/[language]/`
2. Update the query suite file (*.qls) to include the new queries
3. Reference the custom query suite in the workflow file

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with CodeQL scanning:
1. Check the workflow run logs in GitHub Actions
2. Verify the CodeQL configuration matches your project structure
3. Ensure you have sufficient permissions for security events
